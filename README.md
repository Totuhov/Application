## Run Information

- to seed the database it is necessary to uncomment the dataseeder in ApplicationDbContext - OnModelCreating() method <br />
var seeder = new DataSeeder(_env); <br />
seeder.Seed(builder);
- this method is just for database seeding and must be excluded again after creating of the database is done
